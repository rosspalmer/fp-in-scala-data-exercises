## Benefits for Spark Users

- Great for improving knowledge of core Scala syntax and code patterns
- `Option` handling critical to NULL and exception processing in UDFs
- Higher order function patterns can be used to automate complex 
transformations on Dataframe and Datasets
- Error from specific operations can be more robustly using `Either`
