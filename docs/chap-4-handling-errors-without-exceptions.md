# Chapter 4: Handling Errors Without Exceptions

The authors summarize chapter four as such:

_The big idea is that we can represent failures
and exceptions as_

The chapter is structured similar to Chapter 3 by re-creating
Scala native classes, in this case `Option` and `Either`. Working
through this chapter not only improves knowledge of these commonly
used Scala objects, but is critical in creating **complete** Spark
UDFs and error resistant pipelines.
